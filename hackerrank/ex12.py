#calculates the probability to get 'a' from a given squence

#prints the correct probability with at least 3 digits accurisy 
#idea = calc the combination of (n,k) then with Inclusionâ€“exclusion principle clac the amount of a's( could look for the amount that a doesnt show and subtrackst from the total)
#takes way more time to think , and I have a PC to count for me
